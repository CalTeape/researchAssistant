Work undertaken for University of Otago as a research assistant. This research was a collaboration with the Dept. of Food Science, who wanted to investigate the potential use of computer vision to grade food products.

The first project uses OpenCV library to analyze images of bread and detect the level of Fava bean protein enrichment. In particular, we use colour transformations, k-means clustering, image thresholding and 
segmentation to generate statistics about the image. I then used various statistical methods to derive a model which can detect Fava bean enrichment. This research is currently under consideration 
for publication by 'Food Research International'.

The second project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to predict human score of french fries quality from images. Uses CUDA library to accelerate convolutional operations in network training for NVIDIA GPU's. 
Therefore requires conda environment specifically formatted to the GPU. I have computer capability 7.5, so use tensorflow 2.3.0, CUDA v10.1, CUDNN 8.05.
